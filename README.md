A simple application to help organize a game of [assassin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin_(game))
I played this game back in high school as a fundraiser organizered by the student
council. 

At the time there wasn't really a great platform they could find to create the matchups
and monitor the status of everything. 

At the time I helped out by writing a script to make the initial pairings, but
I wanted to revisit the project and fully flesh it out.
